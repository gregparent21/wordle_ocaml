I use the traditional Wordle dictionaries, La and Ta.

La words are words that can be guessed and can be selected as the secret. 
Ta words are words that can be guessed but are never selected as the secret.

To edit these files, one can directly type in the La.txt or Ta.txt files. 
Any added words should follow the following rules:
- All words in the dictionary should be in lowercase 
- All words added should be 5 letters long
- Each word should be separated with a new line.
- All words should be comprised of the 26 english letters
